Built the `review-tone-signal` skill: locked core prompt, five reference documents,
and a verified Phase A pipeline.

**Verified working against live sources:**
- `screen_universe.py` — SIC enumeration via EDGAR atom feeds, join to listed
  tickers, point-in-time market cap. Cross-checked: AAPL $587B, Hasbro $8.39B,
  Helen of Troy $2.65B, UEIC $0.74B at 2016-01-01, all matching history.
- `corpus.py` — streaming access to the 750 GB review corpus, nothing stored.
  Confirmed schema and brand matching on an Appliances sample.
- `coverage.py` — brand→ASIN matching, ambiguity handling, gate reporting.
- `fetch_sec.py` — point-in-time quarterly revenue with original vintages.
  Verified on HELE (FY ends Feb) and HBB (FY ends Dec).

**Defects found and fixed during the build:**
- Stooq is behind a JavaScript bot-check as of 2026-10; replaced with the Yahoo
  chart API.
- Yahoo returns split-adjusted closes; multiplying them by historical share
  counts understated market cap by the cumulative split factor (Apple by 4x).
  Now corrected by a separate split-event query.
- Fiscal quarter labels were taken from the XBRL `fp` field, producing
  `FY2011QFY` for annual filings. Now derived from EDGAR's `fiscalYearEnd`.
- Fiscal year end inferred from the mode of 10-K period ends put Helen of Troy
  in August; it ends in February. A one-month error shifts every join by a
  quarter (F11). Now read from the authoritative field.
- Early quarters whose first XBRL appearance is 400+ days after period end are
  prior-year comparatives, not late reports. Marked `comparative_only` and
  excluded rather than being treated as genuine reporting lags.

**Not built, deliberately:** `extract_reviews.py`, `score_reviews.py`,
`aggregate.py`, `backtest.py`, `degrade.py`. These depend on choices the prereg
has to fix first — test statistic, thresholds, weighting. Writing them now would
mean choosing those after having seen the data, which is the thing the whole
design exists to prevent.
